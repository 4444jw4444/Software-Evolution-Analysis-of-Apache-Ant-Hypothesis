# SEng371-Project2

# Introduction

This project focuses on the Apache-Ant project. The reason we chose this project is because it has both Github data, and publicly available email archives in the form of mbox files. This same project will be able to be run on all other projects which also have these two resources available.

In this project the goal is to, based on the communications that occur, infer the structure of the company. Connecting this to the commits that occur, with other data in the Github system for the project, we should be able to see who the people are that make the largest impact on the code, who is at the center of communications, and determine if the people who we would expect to be at the helm of a project are represented in the data.

# Project Question

Our formal project question is as follows: “Can we determine the hierarchical organization and the social structure within an organization from looking at the codebase and internal communication?”

An example of a situationally specific question is: “Can we create some graphical representation of internal communication”

# Hypotheses

* We can determine the organizational structure.
* We can discover major contributors by mapping communications with a visual representation. 
* We can estimate the development methodologies that Apache uses.
